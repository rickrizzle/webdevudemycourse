<h2>This is My First Article</h2>

<p class="quote">Hello World! And welcome!</p>

<p>This is my first article on my first ever website written in HTML & CSS by myself. Well, almost by myself.</p>
<p>This is part of a series of coding projects for a Udemy couse I've been taking: <strong>Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp</strong>.</div> So far it's been awesome. He's a great instructor and has made some very high quality videos. Since I'm so <em>inpatient</em> with wanting to learn as much as I can and start working on my own projects and start applying for jobs, I've been listening to most of the videos on <strong>1.25x</strong> <strong>1.5x</strong> and even <strong>2.0x</strong> speeds.</p>
<p>This is a little something I picked up from Siraj, another great programmer and instructor I follow on Youtube.</p>

<h2>Here's another article</h2>

<p>Here's some more practice writing.</p>

<P>Although I still feel like an "imposter" I'm slowly starting to connect the dots for HTML and CSS working together. I look forward to getting 
    back to Javscript and honing my skills 
    in the basics of JS. I watched a video on for loops, and did a little practice on those and it was almost clicking for me.
    It's a tough concept when first introduced, but I think a couple more times practing for-loop coding will bring me to a much more clear 
    understanding of loops; for loops in particular.
